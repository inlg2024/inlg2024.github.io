                <h3>Submissions &amp; Format</h3>
                <p>Three kinds of papers can be submitted:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Long papers</span> are most appropriate for presenting
                    substantial research results and must not exceed eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of
                    ethical considerations, supplementary material statements, and references. The supplementary
                    material statement provides detailed descriptions to support the reproduction of the results
                    presented in the paper (see below for details). The final versions of long papers will be given one
                    additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.
                  </li>
                  <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Short papers</span> are more appropriate for presenting
                    an ongoing research effort and must not exceed four (4) pages, plus unlimited pages of ethical
                    considerations, supplementary material statements, and references. The final versions of short
                    papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages) so that reviewers' comments can
                    be taken into account.</li>
                  <li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Demo papers</span> should be no more than two (2) pages,
                    including references, and should describe implemented systems relevant to the NLG community. It also
                    should include a link to a short screencast of the working software. In addition, authors of demo
                    papers must be willing to present a demo of their system during INLG 2024.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Submissions should follow <a
                    href="https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines">ACL Author
                    Guidelines</a> and policies for submission, review and citation, and be anonymised for double blind
                  reviewing. Please use ACL 2024 style files; LaTeX style files and Microsoft Word templates are
                  available at<a href="https://2024.aclweb.org/calls/style_and_formatting/">
                    https://2024.aclweb.org/calls/style_and_formatting/</a>.</p>
                <p>Authors must honour the ethical code set out in the <a
                    href="https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics">ACL Code of Ethics</a>. If your work
                  raises any ethical issues, you should include an explicit discussion of those issues. This will also
                  be taken into account in the review process. You may find <a
                    href="https://aclrollingreview.org/responsibleNLPresearch/">this checklist</a> of use.</p>
                <p>Authors are strongly encouraged to ensure that their work is reproducible; see, e.g., the following
                  <a href="https://2021.aclweb.org/calls/reproducibility-checklist/">reproducibility checklist</a>.
                  Papers involving any kind of experimental results (human judgments, system outputs, etc) should
                  incorporate a data availability statement into their paper. Authors are asked to indicate whether the
                  data is made publicly available. If the data is not made available, authors should provide a brief
                  explanation why. (E.g. because the data contains proprietary information.) A <a
                    href="https://inlg2024.github.io/resource_statement.html">statement guide</a> is available on the
                  INLG 2024 website.</p>
                <p>To submit a long or short paper to INLG 2024, authors can either submit directly or commit a paper
                  previously reviewed by ARR via the same <a href="https://softconf.com/n/inlg2024/">paper submission
                    site</a>. For direct submissions, the deadline for submitting abstracts and titles of papers is May
                  22, 2024, 11:59:59 PM AOE and the full paper submission deadline is May 29, 2024, 11:59:59 PM AOE. If
                  committing an ARR paper to INLG, the submission is also made through the INLG 2024 paper submission
                  site, indicating the link of the paper on OpenReview. The deadline for committing an ARR paper to INLG
                  is June 19, 2024, 11:59:59 PM AOE, and the last eligible ARR paper submission deadline for INLG 2024
                  is April 15, 2024. It is important to note that when committing an ARR paper to INLG, it should be
                  submitted through the INLG 2024 paper submission site, just like a direct submission paper, with the
                  only difference being the need to provide the OpenReview link to the paper and to provide an optional
                  author response to reviews.</p>
                <p>Demo papers should be submitted directly through the INLG 2024 <a
                    href="https://softconf.com/n/inlg2024/">paper submission site</a> by June 15, 2024, 11:59:59 PM AOE.
                </p>
                <p>All accepted papers will be published in the INLG 2024 proceedings and included in the ACL anthology.
                  A paper accepted for presentation at INLG 2024 must not have been presented at any other meeting with
                  publicly available proceedings. Dual submission to other conferences is permitted, provided that
                  authors clearly indicate this in the submission form. If the paper is accepted at both venues, the
                  authors will need to choose which venue to present at, since they can not present the same paper
                  twice.</p>
                <h3><strong>Awards</strong></h3>
                <p>INLG 2024 will present several awards to recognize outstanding achievements in the field. These
                  awards are:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Best Long Paper Award: This award will be given to the best long paper submission based on its

                <h2>SIGDIAL&amp;INLG Call for Workshops</h2>
                <p>The 24th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDial 2024) and
                  the 17th International Natural Language Generation Conference (INLG 2024) will be held jointly in
                  Tokyo, Japan on September 11-15, 2022. We now welcome the submission of workshop and tutorial
                  proposals, which will take place on September 11 and 12 before the main conference.</p>
                <p>We encourage submissions of proposals on any topic of interest to the discourse, dialogue, and
                  natural language generation communities. This program is intended to offer new perspectives and bring
                  together researchers working on related topics. We especially encourage the sessions that would bring
                  together researchers from SIGDial and INLG communities.</p>
                <p>Topics of interest include all aspects related to Dialogue, Discourse and Generation including (but
                  not limited to) annotation and resources, evaluation, large language models, adversarial and RL
                  methods, explainable/ethical AI, summarization, interactive/multimodal/situated/incremental systems,
                  data/knowledge/vision-to-text, and applications of dialogue and NLG.</p>
                <p>The proposed workshops/tutorials may include a poster session, a panel session, an oral presentation
                  session, a hackathon, a generation/dialogue challenge, or a combination of the above. Workshop
                  organizers will be responsible for soliciting, reviewing, and selecting papers or abstracts. The
                  workshop papers will be published in a separate proceedings. Workshops may, at the discretion of the
                  SIGDial/INLG organizers, be held as parallel sessions.</p>
                <h3>Submissions</h3>
                <p>Workshop and Tutorial proposals should be 2-4 pages containing: title, type (workshop or tutorial), a
                  summary of the topic, motivating theoretical interest and/or application context, a list of organizers
                  and sponsors, duration (half-day or full-day), and a requested session format(s):
                  poster/panel/oral/hackathon session, the number of expected attendees. The workshop proposals will be
                  reviewed jointly by the general chair and program co-chairs.</p>

                <h3><strong>Call for new Shared Task proposals</strong></h3>
                <p>We invite submissions of papers describing ideas for future shared tasks in the general area of
                  language generation (Generation Challenges 2024). Proposed tasks can be in the area of core NLG, or in
                  other research areas in which language is generated. Examples include, but are not limited to:
                  data-to-text NLG, text-to-text generation (including MT and summarisation), combining core NLG and MT,
                  combining core NLG and text summarisation, NLG quality estimation, NLG evaluation metrics, and/or
                  generating language from heterogeneous data, including image and video.</p>
                <p>The Generation Challenges (GenChal) are an umbrella event designed to bring together a variety of
                  shared-task efforts that involve the generation of natural language. This year, Generation Challenges
                  will be held during a special session at the 17th International Conference on Natural Language
                  Generation (<a href="https://inlg2024.github.io/index.html">INLG 2024</a>), scheduled on September
                  11-15 2024. The session will follow the format of previous GenChal results sessions, with
                  presentations of results by the organisers of the generation challenges that are currently running, a
                  poster session for task participants to present their submissions, as well as presentations of
                  proposals for new shared tasks in the Task Proposals Track, and discussion sessions. You can see the
                  previous GenChal tasks on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/genchalrepository/home">dedicated
                    repository</a>.</p>
                <p>Submissions should describe possible future tasks in detail, including information regarding
                  organisers, task description, motivating theoretical interest and/or application context, size and
                  state of completion of data to be used, schedule and evaluation plans. Accepted shared tasks will be
                  run in the 2024 iteration of INLG.</p>

                <h3>Submissions &amp; Format</h3>
                <p>Submissions in the Shared Task Proposals track should be no more than 4 (four) pages long excluding
                  citations, and should follow the <a href="https://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html">ACLPUB
                    formatting guidelines</a> and <a
                    href="https://2021.aclweb.org/downloads/acl-ijcnlp2021-templates.zip">template files</a>.</p>
                <p>Proposals should be uploaded to the <a
                    href="https://softconf.com/n/inlg2024/user/scmd.cgi?scmd=submitPaperCustom&amp;pageid=11">SoftConf</a>
                  GenChal submission page, using the Submission type New shared task proposal.</p>
                <p>Submissions will be peer-reviewed by the program committee. As reviewing will not be blind, there is
                  no need to anonymise papers.</p>
                <p>This is not intended to be a selective process, since the aim is to discuss new potential shared
                  tasks with INLG delegates. However, the organisers reserve the right to reject proposals which do not
                  fall within the scope of the GenChal initiative, or which do not follow guidelines. Accepted
                  submissions will be published in separate GenChal 2024 proceedings on the ACL Anthology, <a
                    href="https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2022.inlg-genchal/">as was done in 2022</a>.</p>
