### Call for Generation Challenges 2024
**Submission deadline: June 24th 2024**

We invite submissions of papers describing ideas for future shared tasks in the general area of language generation (Generation Challenges 2024). Proposed tasks can be in the area of core NLG, or in other research areas in which language is generated. Examples include, but are not limited to: data-to-text NLG, text-to-text generation (including MT and summarisation), combining core NLG and MT, combining core NLG and text summarisation, NLG quality estimation, NLG evaluation metrics, and/or generating language from heterogeneous data, including image and video.

The Generation Challenges (GenChal) are an umbrella event designed to bring together a variety of shared-task efforts that involve the generation of natural language. This year, Generation Challenges will be held as a workshop at the 17th International Conference on Natural Language Generation (INLG 2024), scheduled on September 23-27 2024. The workshop will follow the format of previous GenChal results sessions, with presentations of results by the organisers of the generation challenges that are currently running, a poster session for task participants to present their submissions, as well as presentations of proposals for new shared tasks in the Task Proposals Track, and discussion sessions. You can see some of the previous GenChal tasks in the past GenChal proceedings on the ACL Anthology (see e.g. 2022 or 2023) or on the dedicated repository.

Submissions should describe possible future tasks in detail, including information regarding organisers, task description, motivating theoretical interest and/or application context, size and state of completion of data to be used, schedule and evaluation plans. Accepted shared tasks will be run in the 2025 iteration of INLG.

### Important dates
- Submission deadline: June 24th 2024
- Notification: July 15th 2024
- Camera-ready submission: August 16th 2024
- Workshop at INLG conference: September 23rd-24th 2024

All deadlines are 11.59 pm UTC -12h ("anywhere on Earth").

### Submissions and format
Submissions in the Shared Task Proposals track should be no more than 4 (four) pages long excluding citations, and should follow the ACLPUB formatting guidelines (you will find LaTeX style files and Microsoft Word templates under this link).

Proposals should be uploaded to the SoftConf GenChal submission page, using the Submission type New shared task proposal.

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by the program committee. As reviewing will not be blind, there is no need to anonymise papers.
This is not intended to be a selective process, since the aim is to discuss new potential shared tasks with INLG delegates. However, the organisers reserve the right to reject proposals which do not fall within the scope of the GenChal initiative, or which do not follow guidelines. Accepted submissions will be published in separate GenChal 2023 proceedings on the ACL Anthology, as was done in 2022 and 2023.

Looking forward to seeing you at INLG!
