We are excited to share the following speakers have kindly accepted to give invited talks at INLG2024.

## Keynote 1: [Yulan He](https://sites.google.com/view/yulanhe)

**Time:** 25th Sep. 13:30-14:15

**Title:** Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Reflection and Refinement

**Abstract:** The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be greatly improved through reflection and refinement techniques. This talk delves into several scenarios illustrating these advancements. First, we explore how LLM self-refinement, guided by multi-perspective solution seeking and self-consistency checks, produces superior results in question answering (QA) compared to traditional self-reflection approaches. Second, in the domain of student answer scoring, we decompose the scoring process into a series of binary questions that evaluate the presence of key answer elements. This method constructs a thought tree, enabling the generation of rationales and facilitating explainable scoring. Third, we address the challenge of causal event extraction. Unlike many current findings, LLM evaluators do not align well with human evaluation results. To address this,, we propose training a smaller language model on human evaluation data to serve as an evaluator and reward model, allowing us to develop a robust causal event extraction system. Lastly, in the context of mystery murder games, we demonstrate that equipping LLMs with multiple sensory inputs allows for better situational evaluation and more effective navigation in the search for suspects. The talk will conclude with an exploration of future research directions for further enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

**Time:** 27th Sep. 13:30-14:15

**Title:** Embodied Language Generation for Autonomous Robot

**Abstract:** With the improved performance provided by large language models, language generation systems are being used in a wide variety of applications, including robotics. In the field of robotics, language generation systems are used not only for response generation but also for robot's action planning. Embodiment is essential for utilizing language models in such robotic tasks. When performing language generation from the vast amount of real-world information available to the robot, it is important to choose which information to use and to set up a point of view from which to make that choice. This talk will focus on these points while introducing our efforts related to embodied language generation systems for robots.
